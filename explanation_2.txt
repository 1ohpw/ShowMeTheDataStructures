In this problem, I recursively search through 
all of the files in the directory for files with matching suffixes.

The time complexity is O(n) where n represents the # of subdirectories/files 
inside of the target directory. This is because I visit each once.

The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of files with matching suffixes in
the input directory. The return list should match this.
