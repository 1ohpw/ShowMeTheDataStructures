In this problem, I recursively search through 
all of the files in the directory for files with matching suffixes.

The time complexity is subquadratic/O(n*m) where n represents the # of subdirectories/files 
inside of the target directory, and m represents the # of paths within subdirectories. 
I visit each of these different paths and subpaths once.

The space complexity is O(n) where n is the number of files with matching suffixes in
the input directory. The return list should match this.
