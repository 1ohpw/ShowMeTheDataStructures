This solution is done in subquadratic/O(n*m) time where n is the start group + its subgroups,
and m is the number of users in each group.
I take O(n) time to recursively visit a Group and it's subgroups in the directory tree once.
At each Group, I do a linear search through the users array of the group to find
the desired user. 

The space complexity is constant/O(1), the variables are created as part of the loop
and destroyed at the end of every iteration.
